      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>I’m Khrystelle Jan Esplana, a 2nd-year irregular student and a future IT professional in the making. While pursuing my studies, 
        I’m also a working student, actively managing my family’s business by handling funds, social media, and publicity materials. 
        This experience has helped me develop skills in business management, creativity, and multitasking.
        Recently, I’ve taken an interest in crochet as a hobby, and I’m now planning to turn it into a small business. Combining my passion for creativity and entrepreneurship, 
        I’m excited to explore new opportunities while continuing to grow in my field.
